###Tasks:
* recognizing a plant: getting useful information about the maintenance of the plant, including watering frequencies, problems that can aoccur, repotting period etc
* receiving suggestions about which plant to buy: suggesting a plant that meets the user needs in terms of money, effort and aesthetic
* interaction with peers: getting information in a natural language, explained by peers, on specific needs, or just interact with other enthusiasts

###Some contextual information regarding the use of the interactive prototype:
1. the user who is using the system is registered and logged in. 
2. His profile already contains plans, through which suggestions are generated by the application.  
3. some discussion topics are already present on the system (of which only one has been shown the interaction flow)
